    After about a week i have decided that I will create a sprite-based 3d game.
     - Questions:
        What will be the basic network model?
        What will be the base Code Architecture?
        What will be the Slavery level?
        Will I implement encryption?
        What will be the network security model?

    Now it draw a simplified 2d simulation of the map, I have also changed the map input because the parsing wasn't good for the wall collisions.
